# Bank-Customer-Churn-Predection

Customer Churn prediction means knowing which customers are likely to leave or unsubscribe from your service. For many companies, this is an important prediction. This is because acquiring new customers often costs more than retaining existing ones. Once you’ve identified customers at risk of churn, you need to know exactly what marketing efforts you should make with each customer to maximize their likelihood of staying.

Customers have different behaviors and preferences, and reasons for cancelling their subscriptions. Therefore, it is important to actively communicate with each of them to keep them on your customer list. You need to know which marketing activities are most effective for individual customers and when they are most effective.

Customer churn is important because it costs more to acquire new customers than to sell to existing customers. This is the metric that determines the success or failure of a business. Successful customer retention increases the customer’s average lifetime value, making all future sales more valuable and improving unit margins.

The way to maximize a company’s resources is often by increasing revenue from recurring subscriptions and trusted repeat business rather than investing in acquiring new customers. Retaining loyal customers for years makes it much easier to grow and weather financial hardship than spending money to acquire new customers to replace those who have left.
